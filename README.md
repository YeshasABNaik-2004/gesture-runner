âœ¨ Gesture Runner
Gesture Runner is a fun AI-based game where players use real-world body gestures to control a runner â€” moving left or right based on simple motions!

This project uses live camera feed, real-time pose detection, and gesture recognition to map human movement into gameplay.

No keyboard, no mouse â€” just your body and the camera!

ðŸš€ Features
Real-time gesture control with webcam

Move the character left or right by leaning

Play without traditional input devices

Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame

ðŸ§  Technologies Used

Technology	Purpose
OpenCV	Captures live video from the webcam
MediaPipe Pose	Detects body landmarks (shoulders, arms, etc.) using AI
Pygame	Renders the game graphics and handles movement
About MediaPipe Pose:
MediaPipe uses deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to estimate human pose landmarks (like nose, shoulders, elbows, knees) from just a camera feed.
It detects 33 body keypoints using a lightweight model based on Google's BlazePose.
